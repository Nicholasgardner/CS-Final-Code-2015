# CS-Final-Code-2015

Within this repository, you will find 6 gif's that depict different dice sides named *number*.gif, a Python file containing
the source code needed to run this program, named dice.py and a screen shot of the Petals Around the Rose game
you will be trying to implement in class.

##Running the Code

You will need to download (either fork the repository through github or download each of the files to a single directory on your
computer).  You should then open the python file in either IDLE or Sublime Text and run the file. A GUI should appear that will
allow you to roll 2 dice.  The sum of all the dots on the dice will also be displayed with each roll.

##Your assignment for the Final
The code in this repo is for a game that simply rolls two dice and sums the number of dots on the dice.  Your code should, at
a minimum:

* Display 5 dice, whose values change when you click the button.
* Display the sum of petals around the rose (**if statements are your friend here**)
* Display the name "Petals Around the Rose" as the title of the GUI.

###Optional Extra Features
For extra credit, you may implement one of the following features.  Honors students must implement at least one of these features.

* A text field and button that lets you guess the next value.  Your code should also test whether this value is correct or not.
* A splash screen that introduces the user to your game, prior to getting started. This may disappear automatically 
(i.e. - with a timer) or as the result of a button push or key press.
* Text instructions that appear on screen.
* A unique feature set of your design.
